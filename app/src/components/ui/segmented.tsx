 * The same pill is often a router link rather than a button (a nav bar is a
 * segmented control whose items navigate), and a link is a host component the
 * app owns — expo-router's `<Link>`, react-router's `<NavLink>`. Those cannot
 * take a `Pressable` wrapper without losing the router's press handling, so
 * they take the class instead and render their own element.
 *
 * `SegmentedGroup` is the row they sit in: the frame, the `role="group"` and its
 * name, and optionally the current value, so each pill can say `value="week"`
 * instead of `active={view === "week"}`.
 *
 * A pill takes an `iconSlot`, drawn before its label and sized and coloured by the
 * pill, and the group can drop the labels of such pills under a width or at
 * every width (`labelHideBelow`), leaving the label as the pill's name.
